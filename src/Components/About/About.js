                <h2>About Me!</h2>
                    <p>I find fulfillment in problem solving, working on a team, and being presented with new challenges. My background in Multimedia Design has given me the confidence to reliably produce detail oriented, well planned and curated content. Iâ€™m excited to enter a field with plenty of potential to learn more. I am currently attending Nashville Software School and will graduate from the bootcamp program in February 2021.</p>
